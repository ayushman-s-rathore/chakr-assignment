# React Website with Vite

This project is a React website created using Vite. It showcases Chakr assignment. The website is deployed and can be accessed at [https://chakr-assignment-7jz7kr1md-ayushman-s-rathores-projects.vercel.app](https://chakr-assignment-7jz7kr1md-ayushman-s-rathores-projects.vercel.app).

## Issue with Chart Rendering

Please note that there is currently an issue with the rendering of the chart on the deployed site. This issue occurs intermittently, and the chart may not display correctly at times. The problem is related to data fetching from GitHub, which is used for rendering the chart.

### Local Deployment

When deploying the project locally, the chart renders correctly. However, the issue arises when the project is deployed on Vercel, and data fetching from GitHub is involved.
